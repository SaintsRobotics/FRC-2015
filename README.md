# Treecycle-2015

Treecycle's code for the 2015 FRC competition, Recycle Rush.

I tried to make it simple and clear to be useful for future reference. Feel free to contact me ([Shreyas](https://github.com/anubiann00b)) with questions.

The plan is to document the robot on [the GitHub wiki](https://github.com/SaintsRobotics/FRC-2015/wiki). The code, images, and documentation should exist as a future resource and as club history that will outlive the robot itself.
